# Sales Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes sales data to identify sales trends, perform exploratory data analysis, and conduct basic statistical tests.

## Installation

Before running the analysis script, ensure that Python is installed on your system. Then, install the required Python libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Requirements File

The `requirements.txt` file contains all the necessary Python libraries for this project. It includes:

- pandas
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Running the Script

After installing the requirements, you can run the script using the following command:

```bash
python analysis_script.py
```

Replace `analysis_script.py` with the actual name of the script file.

## Figures

The script generates figures based on the analysis and saves them in the `analysis figures` directory. Ensure this directory exists or modify the script to point to a valid directory on your system.

## Data

The analysis is based on sales data provided in a CSV file. Update the script with the correct path to your CSV file before running it.

## Statistical Analysis

The script includes a basic statistical analysis comparing sales between two regions. Ensure your data contains these regions or adjust the script accordingly.
